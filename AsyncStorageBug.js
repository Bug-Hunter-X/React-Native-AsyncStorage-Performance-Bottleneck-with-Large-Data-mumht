In React Native, an uncommon error arises when using AsyncStorage with large amounts of data or deeply nested objects.  The issue isn't a specific error message but rather a performance bottleneck.  The app may become unresponsive or freeze, especially on lower-end devices, during AsyncStorage operations (setItem, getItem, etc.). This often manifests as slow loading times or even crashes, without clear error indicators in the console.
